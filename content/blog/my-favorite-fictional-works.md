Throughout my years in high school and college, I spent a lot of
time reading fictional works. In this post, I will talk about the ones that are my favorite.

There will be no particular order to the list. I may like some more than the others, but this list
does not represent that. I may from time to time come back and update it since I want a place to
note down the works that I like.

## เซวีน่า มหานครแห่งมนตรา by Kalthida

An isekai story before the the trope became popular. The story follows a female protragonist
who on her 17 (ish, I cannot remember the exact number :p) birthday get transported into a magic kingdom.
She has to get situated into a new world, make friends at the magic school and solve the mystery about
her family.

The series consist of five initial books. There are at least two sequels stories that follow the
next generation of the characters.

## Earthsea series by Ursula K. Le Guin

I read the translated version of the series. To my understanding the original works are in English.
This work is what Ancient Magus Bride reminded me of the most. The unique magic system that has
a mysterious touch to it.

To be honest with you, I still do not fully understand the Tehanu book.

## Orion

You will see spaceships, robots, inter-galactic travel, galactic-scale war in this work. Well there
is romance in there too, but the sci-fi elements were the ones that pique my interest the most.
Nowsday, you may not be able to find a copy of these books since I do not think there had been any
new reprint.

## Light and Shadow; and Golden Time

Manhwas adapted from the first two book of a three-book series. Both titles have their share of contraversies.
You will find people online arguing about both titles. What I like about the first title is its strong female lead.

## I became the male lead’s adopted daughter

Something about a story of a female protagonist always draw me in. This is another one of those stories.

## Frieren: Beyond Journey's End

The work that take the anime scene by storm in 2023.

## Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke's Mansion

Another one of the stories with a strong female lead. The anime that is based on this manhwa is also not bad.
